                <p id="FNAF">Five Nights at Freddy's is an American media franchise created by Scott Cawthon, which began with the eponymous 2014 video game and has since gained worldwide popularity.

                    The main video game series consists of nine survival horror games taking place in locations somehow connected to family pizza restaurant Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. In most games, the player takes on the role of a night-time employee, who must utilise tools such as security cameras, lights, doors, and vents to defend themselves against hostile animatronic characters that inhabit the locations. The series’ canon is revealed through voice recordings, minigames, and easter eggs featured throughout the games.</p>
